# Matrix-Inverse-RNN
This repository demonstrates approaches to compute large-scale matrix inversion using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). While the focus is primarily on leveraging RNNs for matrix inversion, an alternative approach using SVD is also included for comparison.

The RNN implementation is based on the method proposed by Jun Wang in the paper:
Jun Wang, "A recurrent neural network for real-time matrix inversion", Applied Mathematics and Computation, Volume 55, Issue 1, 1993.

# Results
- RNN approach achieves efficient and iterative matrix inversion with minimal error compared to the built-in MATLAB function.
- SVD method provides a reliable alternative but is less computationally efficient for real-time large-scale matrix inversion tasks.

# Repository Highlights
This project emphasizes the application of neural networks for numerical computing, showcasing an innovative use of RNNs in the domain of matrix inversion.
